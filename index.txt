      <b>CGST</b>, <b>SGST</b> and <b>IGST</b>.

      <p>
        If the transaction is Intra-State, then CGST and SGST will be

      <span class="title"><b>Why</b></span>
      <p>
        TDS is a way of ensuring that tax is paid on income at the earliest possible opportunity. This helps to prevent
        tax evasion and to ensure that the government receives the tax revenue it is due.
      </p>
      <div class="mt-3"></div>
      <span class="title"><b>When</b></span>
      <p>
        TDS is applicable on a variety of payments, including salaries, rent, interest, dividends, and professional
        fees. The TDS rates vary depending on the type of payment and the income of the deductee.
      </p>
      <div class="mt-3"></div>
      <span class="title"><b>Where</b></span>
      <p>
        TDS is deducted by the deductor at the time of making the payment. The deductor is required to deposit the TDS
        with the government within a specified time period.
      </p>
      <div class="mt-3"></div>
      <span class="title"><b>How</b></span>
      <p>
        The deductor is required to deduct TDS at the prescribed rates and deposit it with the government. The deductor
        is also required to issue a TDS certificate to the deductee, which shows the amount of tax deducted.
      </p>
      <div class="mt-3"></div>
